# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
Working with Bobby was a bit interesting. Going through the Pewlett-Hackard data was very interesting to say the least. The purpose of this analysis was to show P.H. how many employees are preparing for retirement. With so many people retiring it was cool to see how many people were leaving and from which departments would need the most attention with the people retiring. P.H. also wanted to know how many people are eligible for a mentorship program. Which would be great in getting them prepared for new hires in the future.

## Results
Querying the data was fun but there are points that can be addressed here as we look at some of the data. Although the company is huge that is still a lot of employees to replace.
* The 1st point about this data set is there are a lot of employees who were born during January 1952 - December 1955.
* The 2nd point is there are more than 90,000 employees that will be retiring soon. With this amount of people possibly leaving soon I’m shocked at how the company will be able to handle this 
* Another point to look at is there are a lot of engineers and senior staff. This chart looks at the count of all of the people in their departments that are about to retire.

* Another point is there are 6 managers in the chart above. The company will need to investigate getting them replaced and finding managers aren’t an easy thing to do. 

## Summary
As a lot of employees begin to reach that retirement age and are planning on leaving, the company has some serious things to consider. One of them being which roles or positions they should focus on first. I believe the managers and tech leaders should be looked at first. but with more than 90,000 people reaching that retirement age it’s very difficult to gauge who should be replaced first.

Another thing to look at is there are more than enough people in the mentorship program to help with mentoring the newer employees during the "silver tsunami". If need be, some people could be asked to stay slightly longer I’m sure some of the employees wouldn’t mind helping a little further. With keeping an eye on the employee count table, the company can look at the company as a whole when needed to see where the help is needed. Although they are preparing for retirement still understanding where your strength currently is will be a great thing. Another table to look at is the unique titles, since this breaks down the amount of people that are retirement eligible in their specific positions. This will allow the company to take a closer look at which departments may need more help than others.
